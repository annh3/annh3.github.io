Hi! I'm Ann He. I am computer scientist, photographer, writer, runner, and philosophy lover. Born in the hot, humid city of Chengdu, Sichuan, and raised in the even more hot and humid city Houston, Texas, I now call Northern California my home. Feminism and egalitarianism are two broad world-views I align with. Furthermore, I'm convinced that one can always find [practical means to enact idealistic visions](https://annhe.substack.com/p/practical-idealism), and I hope to advance gender equality as well as science & technology in my life.

## Writing 

From time to time, I try my hand at creative writing. A long time ago, I wrote a story called "Twins" which appeared in [this](https://issuu.com/achemagazine/docs/january2011) issue of Ache Magazine.

Since *this* blog will be dedicated mostly to posts on computer science, my current (informal) writing can be found at my substack [dinner guests](https://annhe.substack.com/).

## Academic

I graduated from Stanford University in 2017 with a bachelors in [symbolic systems](https://symsys.stanford.edu/about/span-dig-deep-solve-complex-problems) and a minor in mathematics, and in 2019 with a masters in computer science, focusing in theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.

## Photography

Photography was a big, big part of my life in high school, and I accredit it helping me come to an understanding of myself as a creative person. Most of my work can be accessed [here](http://www.annhephoto.com). In my photos, I am drawn to capturing energies, moods, personalities, essence, and cinematic moments. Some of my favorite photographers are [Sally Mann](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/photo-booth/the-color-of-humanity-in-sally-manns-south), [Nan Goldin](https://www.dazeddigital.com/tag/nan-goldin), Ren Hang, Ryan McGinley (for his existential figures-against-landscapes and energetic portraits of celebrities), Nirrimi Hakanson, Dawoud Bey, and W. Eugene Smith (for his heartbreaking series on the health effects of pollution on the residents of Minamata). [Here's](https://www.dazeddigital.com/photography/article/13201/1/ann-he) an interview I did with Dazed & Confused Magazine.
