I"Ö	<p>Hi! I‚Äôm Ann He. I am computer scientist, photographer, writer, runner, and philosophy lover. Born in the hot, humid city of Chengdu, Sichuan, and raised in the even more hot and humid city Houston, Texas, I now call Northern California my home. Feminism and egalitarianism are two broad world-views I align with. Furthermore, I‚Äôm convinced that one can always find <a href="https://annhe.substack.com/p/practical-idealism">practical means to enact idealistic visions</a>, and I hope to advance gender equality as well as science &amp; technology in my life.</p>

<h2 id="writing">Writing</h2>

<p>From time to time, I try my hand at creative writing. A long time ago, I wrote a story called ‚ÄúTwins‚Äù which appeared in <a href="https://issuu.com/achemagazine/docs/january2011">this</a> issue of Ache Magaine.</p>

<p>Since <em>this</em> blog will be dedicated mostly to posts on computer science, my current (informal) writing can be found at my substack <a href="https://annhe.substack.com/">dinner guests</a>.</p>

<p>I graduated from Stanford University in 2017 with a bachelors in <a href="https://symsys.stanford.edu/about/span-dig-deep-solve-complex-problems">symbolic systems</a> and a minor in mathematics, and in 2019 with a masters in computer science.</p>

<h2 id="photography">Photography</h2>

<p>Photography was a big, big part of my life in high school, and I accredit it helping me come to an understanding of myself as a creative person. Most of my work, which can be accessed <a href="http://annhephoto.com">here</a>, falls under the category of fashion photography, but I also experimented with documenting protests, and some portraits. In my photos, I am drawn to capturing energies, moods, personalities, and cinematic moments.</p>
