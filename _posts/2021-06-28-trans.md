> The transhumanist vision of a profoundly transformed future humanity has attracted many supporters as well as critics from a wide range of perspectives. Transhumanism has been described by a proponent as the “movement that epitomizes the most daring, courageous, imaginative, and idealistic aspirations of humanity,” while according to a prominent critic, it is the world’s most dangerous idea. (from [here](https://transhumanism.fandom.com/wiki/Transhumanism))

Ann He: Around this time last year, I started asking the question, “does the abolition of gender-based oppression imply the abolition of gender categories?”

While I don’t have coherent answers, I’m starting to wonder whether incremental progress is really the way to go with many of our societal issues, and how much risk there is in taking larger steps (in implementing the abolition of gender based oppression.)

In Waking Life, Eamonn Healy notes that biological, cultural, and anthropological progress occurs on a power scale. Our recent technology also grows accordingly.

As technological advances change our definition of human, we cannot avoid questioning what parts of ourselves to leave behind.

To the extent that identities and categories create suffering and hamper us from realizing our true intellectual, aesthetic, and moral potential, are we obligated to leave them behind?

Brave New World author Aldous Huxley would argue that transhumanism poses a threat to morality and democracy, which Simone de Beauvoir may potentially support in existential terms. For Beauvoir, humanity and the ethical ideal are grounded in subjective passion. By envisioning the future as open and contingent, artists and writers challenge the mystification that validate sacrificing the present for the future.

Do transhumanist solutions to gender oppression form a sufficiently ambiguous ethics?

Debnil Sur: Definitely haven't done the reading to answer your question well, but it raised a couple related ones for me. These might be too implementation-dependent to answer a good ethical question, so apologies if so.

Identity categories are used to oppress and to protect. What do legal instruments of protection (like anti-hate crime legislation or minority rights laws) look like without categories? Enforcement through the justice system is suboptimal, but laws do provide basis for recourse. How would transhumanism's technological advances replace things like, say, lawsuits over due process violations of Black students?

Relatedly, categories seem inescapable. Even if tech can suddenly eradicate existing biological bases of oppression, these impulses would morph into new forms and methods of discrimination. In turn, this requires a vocabulary to form a basis for protection. I don't know if/how transhumanist approaches avoid this.

Your post made me think of Paul Preciado’s book Testo Junkie - not a transhumanist, but a really interesting commentary on the interplay of biohacking and gender.

Ann He:

Thanks for the book rec. I feel that I have some questions about the role of law and government. To what extent will human nature be transformed so that protections against harms are less necessary, or take on a different form. That is, can we transition from a society based on dominance to one based on trust?
