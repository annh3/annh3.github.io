The EM algorithm is a generic optimization algorithm for cases where latent variables make the optimization problem difficult. It is an alternating optimization
algorithm based on Jensen's inequality. This post will be concerned with deriving the EM algorihtm from first principles, exploring use cases, such as optimizing mixtures of Gaussians, relating it to variational inference, and showing how it is conceptually similar to Trust Region Policy Optimization.
